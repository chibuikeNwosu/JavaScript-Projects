/* - Task 3 - How do we borrow books? - well the idea here is to put in the name of the book you want to borrow and then get it from the array (The array will no longer contain the book in this case). so i'm guessing we need to check if the book is available first of all(using conditional statement) and then remove it from the object in the array. 

 - SO WE ARE WORKING WITH.
 - objects - that is accessing them
 - loops - to scan for the book in the array - might not need them
 - if - else - satement - to handele situations like check availability & and return message if not available.
